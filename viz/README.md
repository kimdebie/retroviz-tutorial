# VIZ-plots

This folder is intended to get you going with VIZ-plots. It contains the necessary code to view an example VIZ-plot, and clear instructions on how to apply this to other examples. This implementation uses D3.js.

The VIZ-plots are created from `.json` files. An example can be found in this folder, and `vizplot.ipynb` shows you how to create such files.

To view the example VIZ-plot, run `python -m http.server` from this folder to start a local server. More plots are available at `www.kimdebie.nl/TODO`.
